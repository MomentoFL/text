goofy content
above isn't feature content, I am feature content!
whats the difference between main and origin/main??
i'll find this out later - july 9th, 2:04 PM
dude when i switched to "feature" it didn't sync with main when i did "git pull --rebase"?? - 2:07 PM
probably because you didn't do "git pull --rebase <branch_name> - 2:09 PM
okay, i think it works in a linear fashion, could you review back into "feature"? - 2:12 PM
