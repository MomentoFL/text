goofy content
above isn't feature content, I am feature content!
whats the difference between main and origin/main??
i'll find this out later - july 9th, 2:04 PM
dude when i switched to "feature" it didn't sync with main when i did "git pull --rebase"?? - 2:07 PM
probably because you didn't do "git pull --rebase <branch_name> - 2:09 PM
okay, i think it works in a linear fashion, could you review back into "feature"? - 2:12 PM
i'm in feature, the "git pull --rebase <branch_name> works as intended for smooth pulling.
    Steps(will use example):

    - You're in MAIN
    -   git status
    - "git add ." OR "git add <file>"
    - git commit -m "comment"
    - git push origin main
    --the code is now pushed in main--
    --how would you pull from your own branch in the repository? heres how--

    - git checkout <branch_name>
    - You're now in <branch_name>
    -git pull --rebase origin main
    --look in VS code how the pull has pulled in a linear motion instead of a merge--
